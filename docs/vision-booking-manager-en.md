# Vision Document - Unified Booking Management Page

## Background and Purpose

Currently, the booking management system is based on three separate pages (BookingsManager, BookingListView, BookingsNewPage) that provide parallel or complementary functionality. Our goal is to unify all capabilities into a single page (BookingsManager) that provides a perfect, user-friendly experience and allows us to remove the additional pages.

## Core Features

## Benefits of Moving to a Single Page

1. **Simplified User Experience** - One unified interface for all booking management operations
2. **Reduction of Code Duplication** - Easier maintenance and fewer bugs
3. **Ease of Use** - No need to switch between different pages when performing common actions
4. **Performance Improvement** - Loading one code instead of three separate files
5. **Design Consistency** - Uniform look and feel for all booking management processes

## Summary

The updated BookingsManager page will combine all the capabilities currently found in the three separate pages, providing a complete, intuitive, and efficient booking management experience. The goal is to make it easier for users to manage all aspects of bookings from one place, thereby improving efficiency and reducing the learning and implementation time of the system.
